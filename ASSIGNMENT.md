# DevOps Candidate Assignment

## 🎯 Why This Document Exists

This assignment is **not a test of tools or commands**.  
ColoredCow is a small, fast-growing company building its DevOps vertical from the ground up.  
Early DevOps hires here are not just executors — they are **builders**, **problem-solvers**, and **owners**.

This document gives you a **single practical scenario** so we can understand:

- How you think  
- How you break down ambiguity  
- How you take ownership  
- How you make decisions  
- How you communicate  
- How you would operate in a real entrepreneurial environment  

Your responses help us start a meaningful conversation during the evaluation — not judge you on right/wrong answers.

There is **no expected “perfect solution.”**  
We want to understand your *thought process*.

# 🧪 The Scenario Assignment

You’ve just joined ColoredCow as the **first DevOps engineer** in the growing DevOps vertical.  
Your responsibility is to help establish the foundations — technically, operationally, and culturally.

Below are the areas we want you to think through.  
You can answer in bullet points or short paragraphs — no need for long essays.

## **1. Your First 4 Weeks**
What would you prioritize in your first month?

Consider:
- Understanding existing applications  
- Reviewing hosting setups  
- Setting up basic CI/CD  
- Creating documentation  
- Improving internal processes  
- Establishing communication norms  
- Identifying immediate risks

## **2. Designing Our DevOps Foundations**
Share how you would approach building:

- A standard CI/CD pipeline template  
- A basic infrastructure baseline (IaC, environments)  
- Deployment and rollback strategy  
- Monitoring and alerting foundations  
- Security hygiene (secrets, identity, policies)

You don’t need to give configs — your **approach** matters more.

## **3. Making Work Visible**
If you had to create the first DevOps project board or workflow:

- What columns/stages would you define?

Share your ideas.

How would you:

- Identify reusable assets we can publish?

You don’t need prior experience — we want your thinking.
