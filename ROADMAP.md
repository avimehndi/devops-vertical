# DevOps Vertical — Public Roadmap

This roadmap shows how we are building the DevOps vertical at ColoredCow — openly, intentionally, and with an entrepreneurial approach.

We are not scaling an existing team — we are *creating* a service line.  
Every early DevOps engineer contributes not just skills, but foundations, clarity, and proof of value.

---

# 🌱 Phase 1 — Foundations (0–3 Months)

### 🎯 What we are establishing right now
- Core documentation: Vision, Philosophy, Roadmap, Guidelines  
- Initial public case studies demonstrating real reliability/business impact  
- DevOps evaluation assignment + candidate guidelines  
- Public project board (“DevOps Capability Development”)  
- Clear expectations for early DevOps engineers  
- Initial hiring pipeline for T-shaped, entrepreneurial engineers   
- Alignment with early marketing needs (web copy, positioning)

### 💡 Entrepreneurial expectation  
Candidates joining during this phase help define:
- Standards  
- Templates  
- Cases  
- Tools  
- Systems  

This is a builder stage.

---

# ⚙️ Phase 2 — Capability Building (3–6 Months)

### 🎯 What we will develop
- Internal DevOps playbooks for:
  - migrations  
  - CI/CD  
  - IaC  
  - monitoring & alerting  
  - backups & recovery  
  - security baselines  
- Standardized migration checklists  
- Reusable CI/CD templates for multiple stacks  
- Additional high-quality case studies  
- Public-facing examples & demo environments  
- Automation for internal workflows  
- Marketing assets:  
  - website DevOps pages  
  - social content blueprint  
  - case study-driven outreach  

### 💡 T-shaped engineer growth  
Engineers will gain breadth (generalist awareness) and depth (DevOps/SRE mastery)  
This is the stage where individuals evolve into **owners, not operators.**

---

# 🚀 Phase 3 — Service Offering Launch (6–12 Months)

### 🎯 What we will release
- Complete DevOps service catalog (public + internal)  
- Launch of DevOps vertical pages on the website  
- Sales messaging, one-pagers, and capability decks  
- Outreach program to Digital Agencies & Social Sector orgs  
- Internal DevOps/SRE growth pathways & certification  
- Reusable “accelerators” for faster client delivery  
  - CI/CD kits  
  - IaC stacks  
  - Observability templates  
  - Security hardening packs  

### 💡 Entrepreneurial expectation  
Early engineers act as *founders of the vertical*:
- They help create assets that convert to real sales  
- They support marketing content  
- They collaborate in early customer conversations  

This phase makes the vertical *real*.

---

# 📈 Phase 4 — Growth & Optimization (12+ Months)

### 🎯 Long-term expansion
- 8–12 authoritative, ROI-driven case studies  
- DevSecOps, SRE, CloudOps, Observability services  
- A predictable inbound marketing engine  
- Partnership and collaboration programs  
- Strong reliability KPIs (uptime, deployment frequency, MTTR)  
- Tracking business ROI and showcasing value  
- Community engagement & DevOps thought-leadership  

### 💡 What success looks like
A self-sustaining DevOps vertical with:
- Proven delivery  
- Documented excellence  
- Repeatable systems  
- Clear marketing & sales funnels  
- A pipeline of trained, confident T-shaped DevOps engineers

# 🧭 What “T-Shaped & Entrepreneurial” Means Here

## Breadth (“—”)
Early engineers develop broad awareness across:
- frontend & backend basics  
- infrastructure & ops  
- deployment & hosting  
- debugging & communication  
- documentation & storytelling  

## Depth (“|”)
Deep specialization in:
- CI/CD  
- Infrastructure as Code  
- reliability & SRE practices  
- monitoring & incident workflows  
- operational security  

## Entrepreneurial extension
You are a **builder**, not just a contributor:
- You create examples, templates, demos, case studies  
- You help define systems that do not yet exist  
- You take initiative, bring clarity, and propose better ways  
- You help shape sales & marketing material  
- You help grow the vertical, not just execute tasks  

If this excites you, you will thrive here.

- See how early hires actively shape this vertical  
- Notice the emphasis on clarity, ownership, and judgment  
- Use this as context for the DevOps assignment  
- Ask questions through issues if something is unclear  

We evaluate thinking, communication, and ownership —  
**not the number of tools you know.**
