# ColoredCow DevOps Vertical

Welcome to the public repository for the **DevOps Vertical at ColoredCow** — an initiative we are building with intention, long-term vision, and an entrepreneurial spirit. This repository exists not only as a window into how we think about DevOps, but also as a working space for candidates, collaborators, and future team members who want to help shape what this vertical becomes.

ColoredCow is in an exciting phase: we are expanding our capabilities across engineering disciplines, and DevOps is one of the pillars we want to build with depth, maturity, and excellence. At the same time, we operate like a lean, mission-driven team — built on ownership, learning, and the willingness to create things from scratch. This means early team members play a foundational role in shaping the systems, culture, marketing assets, customer engagement, and engineering capabilities that will define our DevOps function for years to come.

This repository is where that journey begins.

## 🌱 Why DevOps at ColoredCow?

DevOps enables us to deliver software that is **reliable, scalable, secure, predictable, and fast** — qualities that strengthen every product we build and every client relationship we hold.

Our vision for the DevOps vertical is documented in  
👉 **[VISION.md](VISION.md)**

In summary:

- We want to build a function that simplifies software delivery across the organisation.
- We want to establish strong practices in CI/CD, cloud infrastructure, automation, observability, and incident management.
- We want to create reusable assets and internal platforms that accelerate engineering teams.
- And we want to take this capability to the market — gradually building DevOps as a revenue-generating service.

This requires not just engineers, but **builders** — people who care about crafting systems, processes, best practices, and culture.

## 🔍 Why We’re Being Open About This

ColoredCow is a **small, transparent company** with a culture of:

- clarity over polish  
- ownership over hierarchy  
- momentum over bureaucracy  

We don’t pretend to have every system, team, or process perfectly established. We are building — thoughtfully, intentionally, and with long-term direction.

Because of that:

### **Early DevOps hires won’t just “do DevOps work.”**  
They will **help establish the vertical**, shape best practices, create reusable assets, build early marketing materials, support initial sales conversations, and set the foundation others will build upon later.

We believe the people who thrive with us are those who:

- are problem-solvers, not task-takers  
- enjoy building systems, not just executing orders  
- communicate clearly and proactively  
- take initiative and think long-term  
- like working in environments that are still evolving  

If this describes you, you’ll likely enjoy the work here.
