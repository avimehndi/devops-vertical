# DevOps Vertical — Public Repository

Welcome to the public-facing repository for building the **DevOps Vertical at ColoredCow**.

This space is designed for:

- Candidates going through our evaluation process  
- Future collaborators  
- Community contributors  
- Anyone who wants to understand how we think about DevOps, automation, and engineering culture  

The DevOps vertical at ColoredCow is in its early, foundational stage. We are not just hiring DevOps engineers—we are **building a DevOps capability from the ground up**, shaping service offerings, creating proof of work, and establishing sustainable engineering practices.  
This requires people who enjoy solving problems, taking ownership, thinking structurally, and contributing to something larger than their own tasks.

## 💡 Why We’re Being Open About This

ColoredCow is a small company with a culture of **clarity over polish**, and **ownership over hierarchy**.  
We don’t pretend to have every system, every team, or every process already perfected.

Early DevOps hires join us not only to do DevOps work—  
but to help **establish a vertical**, shape best practices, and create the foundations others will build on later.

We believe the people who thrive with us are those who:

- are problem-solvers, not task-takers  
- enjoy building systems, not just executing orders  
- communicate clearly and proactively  
- think long-term and take initiative  
- like working in environments that are still evolving  

If this describes you, you’ll probably enjoy the work here.
