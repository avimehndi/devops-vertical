# Public Case Studies

These case studies illustrate the type of DevOps work we do at ColoredCow — with an emphasis not only on technical execution, but on **ownership**, **initiative**, and the **entrepreneurial mindset** we expect from our early DevOps team members.

Early hires are not joining a fully established vertical.  
You are helping **build** it — shaping the practices, improving systems, and creating the very assets (case studies, playbooks, frameworks) that future engineers will rely on.

## ✨ Case Study 1 — Stabilising an EdTech Platform

### **Context**
A social-sector EdTech platform serving thousands daily experienced frequent downtime, unpredictable releases, and a lack of monitoring.

### **Our Role**
We took end-to-end ownership:
- Diagnosed root causes across infra, CI/CD, and application runtime
- Built reliable pipelines and a stable deployment flow
- Added monitoring, dashboards, and alerting
- Containerised parts of the system for predictable environments

### **Outcomes**
- **80% reduction in downtime**  
- **Deployments became 6× faster**  
- **~25% infra cost reduction**  

### **How This Reflects Our Culture**
This work demonstrates our approach:
- step into ambiguous systems  
- take charge of long-term reliability  
- improve documentation & clarity  
- fix what needs to be fixed, even if it isn’t “in the ticket”

## ✨ Case Study 2 — CI/CD Modernisation for a Digital Agency

### **Context**
A digital agency running 20+ projects struggled with slow, inconsistent deployments due to manual steps.

### **Our Role**
We redesigned their deployment ecosystem:
- Reusable CI/CD templates across multiple project types
- Single-click deployment flows
- Environment parity through containerisation
- Standardised security and access policies
- Developer-facing documentation

### **Outcomes**
- **70% fewer release errors**  
- **Uniform deployment process**  
- **Improved developer confidence & velocity**

### **How This Reflects Our Culture**
Early DevOps engineers here don’t just “set up pipelines.”  
They look at the broader developer experience and ask:
- What slows the team down?
- How can we design a system that scales?
- What can we automate so others move faster?

## ✨ Case Study 3 — SaaS Cost Optimisation

### **Context**
An early-stage SaaS product was struggling with rising cloud costs.

### **Our Role**
We worked as DevOps engineers *and* business partners:
- Identified unused or overprovisioned resources
- Set lifecycle policies
- Recommended storage & compute alternatives
- Added usage monitoring and alerts
- Advised on long-term architectural decisions

### **Outcomes**
- **37% reduction in cloud cost in 3 weeks**
- Better performance
- A clear cost–value roadmap

### **How This Reflects Our Culture**
This shows our entrepreneurial side:
- DevOps = business impact, not just tooling  
- Decisions are taken with ROI, customer needs, and sustainability in mind  
- Engineers are expected to think like owners, not executors

## 🌱 Why We Publish These Case Studies

We publish these case studies openly so candidates can understand:

- The level of **ownership** and **thought process** we value  
- The kind of **initiative** early hires are expected to take  
- The **breadth and depth** (T-shaped engineering) expected in this vertical  
- The **business-oriented mindset** behind our technical work

If these resonate with you, you will likely enjoy working and building with us.
